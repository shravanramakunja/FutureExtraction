# Data Science Practice - Countries Dataset Analysis

A hands-on data science practice project for learning pandas, data exploration, and feature extraction techniques using real-world country data.

## Learning Objectives

This is a practical exercise designed for data science beginners to practice:

- **Data exploration** and understanding dataset structure
- **Pandas operations** for data manipulation and filtering
- **Feature extraction** and data transformation techniques
- **Statistical analysis** and pattern recognition
- **Real-world data cleaning** and preprocessing

## Practice Dataset

Working with `Countries.csv` - a rich dataset containing 195+ countries with multiple data dimensions:

- **Geographic**: Regions, continents, coordinates
- **Demographic**: Population, life expectancy, urban/rural splits
- **Economic**: GDP, inflation, unemployment rates
- **Political**: Democracy scores, government types, leaders
- **Environmental**: CO2 emissions, renewable energy, forest coverage
- **Infrastructure**: Internet access, electricity, healthcare metrics

## Practice Exercises

The `Extraction.ipynb` notebook contains hands-on exercises for:

### Basic Data Exploration

- Loading and inspecting the dataset structure
- Understanding data types and missing values
- Getting basic statistical summaries

### Population Analysis Practice

- Finding countries with highest/lowest populations
- Identifying capitals of populous countries
- Analyzing population distribution patterns

### Regional Data Filtering

- Counting countries by region (Eastern Europe, Africa, etc.)
- Filtering data by continent
- Comparing regional statistics

### Political Data Analysis

- Ranking countries by democracy scores
- Finding countries with specific government types
- Text analysis on country names (e.g., "Republic" mentions)

### Data Quality Checks

- Identifying missing political leader information
- Detecting null values across columns
- Data validation techniques
